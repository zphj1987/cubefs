## Overview

CubeFS (储宝文件系统 in Chinese) is a cloud-native storage platform that provides both POSIX-compliant and S3-compatible interfaces. It is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a [incubating](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) project.

CubeFS has been commonly used as the underlying storage infrastructure for online applications, database or data processing services and machine learning jobs orchestrated by Kubernetes. 
An advantage of doing so is to separate storage from compute - one can scale up or down based on the workload and independent of the other, providing total flexibility in matching resources to the actual storage and compute capacity required at any given time.

Some key features of CubeFS include:

- Multiple Access Protocol Support  
  Converge posix filesystem interfaces、S3-compatible interfaces and hdfs interfaces
- Metadata Highly Scalable  
  Elasticity, scalability and strong consistency of metadata
- High Performance  
  Specific performance optimizations for large/small files and sequential/random writes
- Multi-tenancy  
  Share the whole storage and resource utilization ratio
- Hybrid Cloud Acceleration  
  Accelerate Hybrid Cloud IO performance through multi-level caching
- Online Erasure Coding Subsystem  
  Provide high durability, high availability, low cost erasure coding storage system

We are committed to making CubeFS better and more mature. Please stay tuned.

## Build CubeFS

Prerequisite:
* Go version `>=1.16`
* `export GO111MODULE=off`


### Build for x86
```
$ git clone http://github.com/cubefs/cubefs.git
$ cd cubefs
$ make
```
### Build for arm64 

For example,the current cubefs directory is /root/arm64/cubefs,build.sh will auto download  follow source codes to vendor/dep directory :
bzip2-1.0.6  lz4-1.9.2  zlib-1.2.11  zstd-1.4.5
  gcc version as  v4 or v5:
    ```
    cd /root/arm64/cubefs
    export CPUTYPE=arm64_gcc4 && bash ./build.sh
    ```

  gcc version as  v9 :
      ```
    export CPUTYPE=arm64_gcc9 && bash ./build.sh
      ```
#### Also support cross compiler with docker:

gcc version as  v4, support Ububtu 14.04 and up version,CentOS7.6 and up version. Check libstdc++.so.6 version must more than `GLIBCXX_3.4.19',if fail please update libstdc++. 

```
cd /root/arm64/cubefs
docker build --rm --tag arm64_gcc4_golang1_13_ubuntu_14_04_cubefs ./build/compile/arm64/gcc4

make dist-clean
docker run  -v /root/arm64/cubefs:/root/cubefs arm64_gcc4_golang1_13_ubuntu_14_04_cubefs /root/buildcfs.sh

```
 
Remove image:
```
docker image remove -f  arm64_gcc4_golang1_13_ubuntu_14_04_cubefs
```


## Yum Tools to Run a CubeFS Cluster for CentOS 7+

The list of RPM packages dependencies can be installed with:

```
$ yum install https://ocs-cn-north1.heytapcs.com/cubefs/cfs-install-latest-el7.x86_64.rpm
$ cd /cfs/install
$ tree -L 2
.
├── install_cfs.yml
├── install.sh
├── iplist
├── src
└── template
    ├── client.json.j2
    ├── create_vol.sh.j2
    ├── datanode.json.j2
    ├── grafana
    ├── master.json.j2
    └── metanode.json.j2
```

Set parameters of the CubeFS cluster in `iplist`. 

1. `[master]`, `[datanode]`, `[metanode]`, `[monitor]`, `[client]` modules define IP addresses of each role. 

2. `#datanode config` module defines parameters of DataNodes. `datanode_disks` defines `path` and `reserved space` separated by ":". The `path` is where the data store in, so make sure it exists and has at least 30GB of space; `reserved space` is the minimum free space(Bytes) reserved for the path.

3. `[cfs:vars]` module defines parameters for SSH connection. So make sure the port, username and password for SSH connection is unified before start.

4. `#metanode config` module defines parameters of MetaNodes. `metanode_totalMem` defines the maximum memory(Bytes) can be use by MetaNode process.

```yaml
[master]
10.196.0.1
10.196.0.2
10.196.0.3
[datanode]
...
[cfs:vars]
ansible_ssh_port=22
ansible_ssh_user=root
ansible_ssh_pass="password"
...
#datanode config
...
datanode_disks =  '"/data0:10737418240","/data1:10737418240"'
...
#metanode config
...
metanode_totalMem = "28589934592"
...
```

For more configurations please refer to [documentation](https://cubefs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/master.html).

Start the resources of CubeFS cluster with script `install.sh`. (make sure the Master is started first)

```
$ bash install.sh -h
Usage: install.sh -r | --role [datanode | metanode | master | objectnode | console | monitor | client | all | createvol ] [2.1.0 or latest]
$ bash install.sh -r master
$ bash install.sh -r metanode
$ bash install.sh -r datanode
$ bash install.sh -r monitor
$ bash install.sh -r client
$ bash install.sh -r console
```

Check mount point at `/cfs/mountpoint` on `client` node defined in `iplist`. 

Open [http://[the IP of console system]](https:/github.com/cubefs/cubefs) through a browser for web console system(the IP of console system is defined in `iplist`).  In console default user is `root`, password is `CubeFSRoot`. In  monitor default user is `admin`,password is `123456`.

## Run a CubeFS Cluster within Docker

A helper tool called `run_docker.sh` (under the `docker` directory) has been provided to run CubeFS with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -r -d /data/disk
```

Note that **/data/disk** can be any directory but please make sure it has at least 10G available space. 

To check the mount status, use the `mount` command in the client docker shell:

```
$ mount | grep cubefs
```

To view grafana monitor metrics, open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in browser and login with `admin/123456`.
 
To run server and client separately, use the following commands:

```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -b
$ docker/run_docker.sh -s -d /data/disk
$ docker/run_docker.sh -c
$ docker/run_docker.sh -m
```

For more usage:

```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -h
```

## Helm chart to Run a CubeFS Cluster in Kubernetes 

The [cubefs-helm](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs-helm) repository can help you deploy CubeFS cluster quickly in containers orchestrated by kubernetes.
Kubernetes 1.12+ and Helm 3 are required. cubefs-helm has already integrated CubeFS CSI plugin

### Download cubefs-helm

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs-helm
$ cd cubefs-helm
```

### Copy kubeconfig file
CubeFS CSI driver will use client-go to connect the Kubernetes API Server. First you need to copy the kubeconfig file to `cubefs-helm/cubefs/config/` directory, and rename to kubeconfig

```
$ cp ~/.kube/config cubefs/config/kubeconfig
```

### Create configuration yaml file

Create a `cubefs.yaml` file, and put it in a user-defined path. Suppose this is where we put it.

```
$ cat ~/cubefs.yaml 
```

``` yaml
path:
  data: /cubefs/data
  log: /cubefs/log

datanode:
  disks:
    - /data0:21474836480
    - /data1:21474836480 

metanode:
  total_mem: "26843545600"

provisioner:
  kubelet_path: /var/lib/kubelet
```

> Note that `cubefs-helm/cubefs/values.yaml` shows all the config parameters of CubeFS.
> The parameters `path.data` and `path.log` are used to store server data and logs, respectively.

### Add labels to Kubernetes node

You should tag each Kubernetes node with the appropriate labels accorindly for server node and CSI node of CubeFS.

```
kubectl label node <nodename> cubefs-master=enabled
kubectl label node <nodename> cubefs-metanode=enabled
kubectl label node <nodename> cubefs-datanode=enabled
kubectl label node <nodename> cubefs-csi-node=enabled
```

### Deploy CubeFS cluster
```
$ helm install cubefs ./cubefs -f ~/cubefs.yaml
```
